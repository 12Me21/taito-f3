<h1>Clip Intervals</h1>

<p>there are four Clip Intervals, each of which consists of a Left and Right value (ranging 0-511) [data ref: lineram subsection 1.0 to 1.3, 0.2, 0.3], which equates to an interval of [left−47, right−48) (in screen pixels)
(for example: left=47 and right=50 ⇒ [0,2) i.e. the first two columns of the screen)
<p>each layer can use any combination of these intervals or their complements, and the visible parts are unioned together to produce a final mask (which can then be inverted as well)
