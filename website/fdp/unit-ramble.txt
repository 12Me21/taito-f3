spx/tpx = 1 - zoom/256

in units of 128(tpx/spx)

this is wrong i think.

ok so an example. let's say we have something in units of "thou" that is 1/1000 inches.
so if i say "7 thou" that is  7 * 1/1000 inches, or 0.007 inches

so uh, if 

well we have written that:
spx/tpx = 1 / (vzoom/128)
which we can rearrange into:
(tpx/spx) = vzoom/128
128*(tpx/spx) = vzoom
but like... 
maybe what we really want is, a value that can be multiplied by vzoom to get a result in tpx/spx (the thing we want)
i.e. 
1/128*(tpx/spx)*vzoom

ok let's say vzoom is $40.
that equates to 2 spx/tpx, or 0.5 tpx/spx
so. vzoom/128 = tpx/spx.

now let's do hzoom
more complex,
spx/tpx = 1 / (1 - hzoom/256)
1 - tpx/spx = hzoom/256
agh but like. ok um

we want to say, what are the units of "hzoom"
given:
cooked[spx/tpx] = 1 / (1 - hzoom/256)[tpx/spx]
cooked[tpx/spx] = (1 - hzoom/256)[tpx/spx]
cooked[tpx/spx] = 1[tpx/spx] - hzoom/256[-tpx/spx]
ugh  idk

X Zoom, in [texture pixels/screen pixels] = hzoom uhh

ugh no let's just 
ok what i have is fine, it's just not  "in units of" it's

X Zoom, in [texture pixels/screen pixels] = 1 - hzoom/256


ugh no something is still wrong here..
we need to say this:
a value of 1 hzoom, the unit of 1 hzoom, is uh
maybe the conversion factor from whatever units hzoom is, to tpx/spx?
so.
but we can't make a conversion factor since hzoom is has both a different slope and a different zero, than tpx/spx.. i guess. like it wouldn't be a "factor".  actually lets check how they handle this with temperature C and F which also are not zeroed

but first ok let's go back to:
xzoom{tpx/spx} = 1{tpx/spx} − (raw_xzoom{256 tpx/spx} / 256{dimensionless}){tpx/spx}



1-hzoom/256
256/256 - hzoom/256
(hzoom - 256)/-256
1 - hzoom/256
