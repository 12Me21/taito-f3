alright, so, to understand blending we only need to think about a single screen pixel at a time. (todo explain this better; this is VERY IMPORTANT. the screen pixel is our entire world!)

each of the eight graphics layers provides the following data for its pixel:
- color id (13-bit number)
- alpha select (1-bit)
- priority (4-bit)
- blend mode (2-bit)

these are then inserted into The Priority Table. (if the color is not opaque; need to explain that better. do we pretend a "non-empty" bit exists (which is i suspect how the hardware works) or just pretend color 0 means empty?)
it has 2 columns, and 16 rows. each cell stores a color id, alpha select, and maybe an invalid bit.
the priority value and blend mode are used to select which cell(s) are filled.
priority selects the row, and blend mode selects whether we fill column A, B, or both (or neither, effectively disabling the layer)
if the same cell is filled from multiple sources, this causes a Priority Conflict. this causes it to appear like the background color layer, if used (todo explain this better)

then, after the table has been filled, the fdp picks the frontmost(?) cell in each column.
these 2 colors will be sent out of the fdp, to be converted to rgb and then blended by the fda.
but first, we need to choose the associated alpha values to send. this is where the alpha select bit is used. 
there are 4 alpha values. 2 for half-pixel A and 2 for half-pixel B. each half-pixel's alpha select determines which one is used. (needs rewriting a lot)

then we should have examples
