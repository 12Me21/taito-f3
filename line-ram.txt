bit 11: tilemap infinite vertical stretch?

bit 15: weird horizontal stretch shadow mode
bit 8: sprite mosaic
bit 9: NOT pivot mosaic

seems to be all bg color index but not 100% sure

lineram has 8 "sections" (traditionally referred to as 4000,5000,...,A000,B000 because that's where every game maps them)
each section can be mapped to one of 16 possible locations within the $62.... block of graphics ram (though, the first two would interfere with other things)

each section contains four "subsections" (traditionally named 000,200,400,600)
each subsection can occur in one of two positions within its section: either at its base address, or that address plus $800

each subsection contains a list of 256 words, which control some parameter(s) on each scanline. (todo: what do we call these values (the raw 16-bit values, containing multiple parameters))

the mapping of sections and subsections, and latching (reusing the same parameters across multiple scanlines) is controlled by the "latches".
at $620000, there is a latch per scanline per section (todo: better language to describe arrays-of-arrays)

latch:
address: [*010 0000 sssl llll lll-]
s [0,8)   section
l [0,256) scanline
data: [..mm mm.. aaaa llll]
m [0,16) mapping address (maps this section to address 0x620000 + 0x1000*m)
for each subsection (lsb to msb):
 a (bool) subsection alternate bank: 1 = add 0x800 to the subsection address (note: does nothing if latch is 0)
 l (bool) subsection latch: 1 = read parameter from lineram, 0 = reuse previous value (this persists across frames. i.e. if 0 on the first scanline, uses value from the last scanline of the previous frame)

line ram subsection:

address: [*010 mmmm auul llll lll-]
m [0,16)  section mapping (from the section's latches)
a (bool)  subsection bank (from the section's latches)
u [0,4)   subsection number
l [0,256) scanline

data: varies by subsection
