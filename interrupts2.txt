interrupt 2
happens at the beginning of vblank
(i.e. near the end of scanline 255, after the last visible pixel)

interrupt 3
happens ~712Âµs (~10850 cpu cycles) after interrupt 2, in the middle of vblank
(i.e. near the end of 'scanline' 4)

interrupt 5
configurable interval timer, controlled by a 16bit register at address 0x4C0000
[..e. rrrr rrrr rrrr]
e: 1 = enable
r: rate
this interrupt will fire every (0x4000 + rate*8 + 32) cpu cycles
(this formula matches my hardware measurements to within ~10 cycles)
