interrupt 2
happens at the beginning of vblank
(i.e. near the end of scanline 255, after the last visible pixel)

interrupt 3
happens ~712Âµs (~10850 cpu cycles) after interrupt 2, in the middle of vblank
(i.e. near the end of 'scanline' 4)

interrupt 5
configurable interval timer, controlled by a 16bit register at address 0x4C0000
[..e. rrrr rrrr rrrr]
e: 1 = enable
r: rate
this interrupt will fire every (0x4000 - rate*8 + 32) cpu cycles
(this formula matches my hardware measurements to within ~10 cycles)



0x4000 + rate*8 + 32 = 

64.75305403582402758000449673986358 usec per line
0.06562502255860150451926717849809261 usec per cycle
986.7128651727497564265907217267478 cycle per line

pixel time = 1 / (26.686MHz/4)
cpu cycle time = 1 / (30.47618MHz/2)
scanline time = pixel time * 432
cycles per scanline = 986.713

timer formula: 0x4000 - rate*8 + 32 = cycles
hblank interrupt rate = 0x788.A9 (games use 0x78B)
