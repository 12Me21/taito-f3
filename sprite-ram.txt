command 
at 0xA value 0x04 flashes different colors   bit depth??
       value 0x10  very corrupted graphics text characters off by 1  broken sync signal    maybe broken horizontal flip mode??
       value 0x20  (flipscreen)
       rest  nothing?
       
sprite jump is not 12 bits  probably 11  nope just 10


scroll offsets:
- both scrolls can be set at once (e.g. 0b1111) to the same value
- scroll is always set from the un-adjusted coordinates (i.e. ignore bits dont matter)
- ignore bits:
 - 0b1000 is the same as 0b0000 (!) - use both offsets
 - 0b0100 - ignore scroll set by 0b0001
 - 0b1100 - ignore both
- scroll is applied BEFORE rendering the current sprite(!) (i.e. using the set scroll bits on a visible sprite will render it at 2x the listed position)
- basically, the sequence of events is
 - read the x and y positions
 - set the scrolls if specified
 - add the scrolls if specified
 - use this value to render the sprite

- the y position is 12 bits (e.g. 0x7000 = 0x0000 ≠ 0x0800)
