command 
at 0xA value 0x04 flashes different colors   bit depth??
       value 0x10  very corrupted graphics text characters off by 1  broken sync signal    maybe broken horizontal flip mode??
       value 0x20  (flipscreen)
       rest  nothing?
       
sprite jump is not 12 bits  probably 11  nope just 10


scroll offsets:
- both scrolls can be set at once (e.g. 0b1111) to the same value
- scroll is always set from the un-adjusted coordinates (i.e. ignore bits dont matter)
- set bits:
 - 0b0000 - set neither
 - 0b0001 - set one ("local")
 - 0b0010 - set the other ("global")
 - 0b0011 - set both
- ignore bits:
 - 0b1000 is the same as 0b0000 (!) - use both offsets
 - 0b0100 - ignore scroll set by 0b0001 (use "global" only)
 - 0b1100 - ignore both
- scroll is applied BEFORE rendering the current sprite(!) (i.e. using the set scroll bits on a visible sprite will render it at 2x the listed position)
- basically, the sequence of events is
 - read the x and y positions
 - set the scrolls if specified
 - add the scrolls if specified
 - use this value to render the sprite

- the x and y positions are 12 bits (e.g. 0x7000 = 0x0000 ≠ 0x0800)

- word 5 (tile id high) has at least 2 bits for the tile id. but i suspect carts can support 3 or 4

- a sprite IS rendered if the command bit is set, as well as if the lower 16 bits of the id is 0 (and upper bits are set) - but not sure if sprites are rendered if all id bits are 0, our rom has a blank sprite there i think

- approximately 880 sprites can be rendered total ?

sprite word 5:
[???? ???? edca ??tb]
 b - (command mode only) set bank (todo test this more)
 t - (command mode only) disable clearing? seems to have a strange effect in reality though. may require using both banks or something.
the first 2 bits are the upper bits of the tile id regardless of whether we're in command mode or not
 a - (both) flip each group of 4 columns (texture relative)?
 c - (both) mix up rows? not similar to the previous
 d - (both) display right half different?
 e - (both) squish vertically and display bottom different?
 in command mode, if the $00F0 nibble is set to 3, 5, 11, or 13, sprites disappear. when changed out of these modes, they reappear and there are garbage pixels for a frame (but the amount of garbage pixels can vary a lot)
